          Giratina is a large, gray, draconic Pokémon with three gold half-rings on each side of its long neck. Its head
          has a gold crown-like object surrounding it with two large horns pointing sideways. A thick black stripe runs
          vertically along its front with five red horizontal stripes. In its Altered Forme, it has two large black
          ghostly wings with three red tips on each that can resemble claws. These wings can change shape as if made of
          a liquid or gas. Its six legs are thick and have golden claws. Two golden half-circles similar to those on its
          neck are on each side of each leg, resembling shackles. It has a tail. Giratina remains in Altered Forme when
          outside of its home dimension.

          In its Origin Forme, it takes on a serpentine look. Its legs are reduced to golden-tipped spikes, and four
          additional golden spikes appear near the edge of its tail. While in Origin Forme, the six gold half-rings can
          grip objects. The back points of each half-ring have a black ghostly tendril with red a spike at its tip. The
          horns on its head are now facing the back. The sides of the golden "crown" cover its mouth and separate
          vertically like an insect's mandible when it opens its mouth. The black vertical stripe is broken into pieces
          and runs all the way down its body. Giratina can only be in its Origin Forme when in its home, the Distortion
          World, or when holding either a Griseous Orb or Griseous Core. Giratina can also maintain its Origin Forme in
          the real world without items should it get a sufficient amount of power, enough to potentially be equal to
          Arceus. Giratina is at its full power when in the Origin Forme.

          The Origin Forme of Giratina is said to be Giratina's true form, capable of traveling through and controlling
          dimensions besides those of time and space. When in its Origin Forme, it is able to pass through dimensions at
          will, however, it will turn back to its Altered Forme due to the gravity change from the Distortion World.
          Giratina has the power to turn itself into a shadow and to merge the Distortion World with the Pokémon world,
          as seen during the events of Spear Pillar. However, this has the dangerous side of effect of distorting it to
          the risk of being destroyed. Giratina is a highly aggressive and territorial Pokémon that is protective of its
          home. Legends claim that Giratina appears in cemeteries and that it supposedly lives in a world on the reverse
          side of the Pokémon world. Giratina has also been reported to appear in ancient cemeteries. As seen in Pokémon
          Legends: Arceus, Giratina has the power to tear a hole in reality, creating a space-time rift along with
          driving both Dialga and Palkia berserk. The rift is capable of creating the Alpha Pokémon and driving Noble
          Pokémon into berserk Lord/Lady States. Giratina is said to be equal in strength to Dialga and Palkia.
